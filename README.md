so its quite a big list guys, 1 2 3 4 syllable words are mostly correct though not totally, some weird medical ones somehow got in there. but its still enough to build a probability engine off of though to correct the rest of the words which i plan to do. hopefully its successful and soon we will have an even bigger better more correct list of words
